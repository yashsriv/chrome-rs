args:
  - METHOD:
      help: The HTTP method to be used for the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, ...).
      long_help: |
        The HTTP method to be used for the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, ...).

        This argument can be omitted in which case chrome will use POST if there is
        some data to be sent, otherwise GET\:

          $ chrome example.com          \# => GET
          $ chrome example.com foo=bar  \# => POST
      required: true
      index: 1

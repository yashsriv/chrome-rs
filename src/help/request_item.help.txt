, Data fields, etc.

Optional key-value pairs to be included in the request. The separator

  '==' URL parameters to be appended to the request URI:

    q==braze

  '=' Data fields to be serialized into a JSON object (with --json, -j)
      or form data (with --form, -f):

    name=braze  language=rust  description=\"CLI http client\"

  ':=' Non-string JSON data fields (only with --json, -j):

    awesome:=true  amount:=42  colors:='[\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]'

  '@' Form file fields (only with --form, -f):

    cs@~/Documents/CV.pdf

  '=@' A data field like '=', but takes a file path and embeds its content:

    essay=@Documents/essay.txt

  ':=@' A raw JSON field like ':=', but takes a file path and embeds its content:

    package:=@./package.json

  You can use a backslash to escape a colliding separator in the field name:
